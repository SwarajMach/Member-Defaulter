# Predict churn of member housing policies
Data Models to predict if a member is defaulter or not: It is a simple data science project (travellers data challenge) to understand the number of customers who might possibly cancel their housing policies before the end of a 5 year period.
To clean the data and perform data exploration I wrote custom SQL queries in SQL server management studio.
For data visualization and basic feature transformation like PCA and covariance analysis I used SAS-JMP PRO
To create training, validation and Test data set I used python Pandas, Numpy and Sci-kit Learn libraries
Analyzed the AUC scores, Lift curves and confusion matrix. 
To improve the AUC score , I used ensemble models such as Random forest, Gradient boost and Xgboost. Overall Gradient boost provided the best scores and minimum error.
